# Sudoku AI

The repository includes an easy to use p5 version of the algorithm.

## Getting Started

To clone the program on your local computer you can run 
```
'git clone https://github.com/TakanoriCodronAkieda/Sudoku-AI.git'
```
into the command line / terminal of your machine.

### Prerequisites

The python (3.0 or above) version does not require any third party package.

To run the javascript version with the nicer user interface, you will need p5.js.  
If you are cloning the repository, p5.js will come automatically.  

You can also download p5.js from here: https://p5js.org/download/

Or use p5.js's online web editor: https://editor.p5js.org/
