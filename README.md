# Sudoku AI

An algorithm that solves easy Sudoku where no branching is required.  
The repository includes an easy to use p5 version of the algorithm.

## Getting Started

To clone the program on your local computer you can run 
```
'git clone https://github.com/TakanoriCodronAkieda/Sudoku-AI.git'
```
into the command line / terminal of your machine.

### Prerequisites

The python (3.0 or above) version does not require any third party package.

To run the javascript version with the nicer user interface, you will need p5.js.  
However, if you are cloning the repository, p5.js will come automatically.  

You can also download p5.js from here: https://p5js.org/download/

Or use p5.js's online web editor: https://editor.p5js.org/

## Future Work

A method that would allow the AI to solve Sudokus with branching is needed.  
Also, a responsive layout for the Javascript version would be great as it would allow the project to be hosted on github pages.
